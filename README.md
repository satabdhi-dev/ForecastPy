# ForecastPy: Demand Forecasting with Python 📈

ForecastPy is a machine learning project focused on **demand forecasting** using Python.  
It leverages time-series techniques and predictive modeling to help businesses make **data-driven inventory and supply chain decisions**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning for demand data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Multiple forecasting approaches:
  - Classical statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.)
  - Machine learning methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model evaluation & accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)  
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook workflow  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** (data wrangling)  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (visualization)  
- **scikit-learn** (machine learning models & evaluation)  
- **statsmodels** (statistical time-series forecasting)  
- (Optional) **XGBoost** / **LightGBM** (boosted trees for demand prediction)
